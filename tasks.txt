
build a website which shows plots and stuff, it should be able to compute isoprob and dls score and compare them 1 person 
plots and stats
---arjun,jagath

write the report in latex as given in template find which plot and tables we can show  1 person --- atharva

write the code and find a way to get 1999 world cup ball by ball data 2 person --- adithya, ankush


Notes
*)In the report we can include strategy for team 1 and team 2 , 
advantages -more fare 
- example from ppt
and disadvantages -if interrupted in first innings we dont know what to do
- wont work well when runs are veryy low
of isoprobability rule
*)when does the isoprob rule fails.


new tasks:
The code is finished and we have got the parameters after running on smaller dataset.
Now @Jagat Chandra CSA run the code on larger dataset given folder and save those parameters and look for plots and tables to include in report
@ARJUN ◕‿◕ calculate the score on the basis of currently computed parameters replace them when jagath is done with training
@Adithya Ponnuraj apart from writing loss function cooperate with @arjun with what you want to display on website
@Atharv Suryawanshi did you start working on report, also we have to prepare a ppt so look into that
