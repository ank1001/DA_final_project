#### Introduction
 In the game of cricket, matches are occasionally interrupted due to rain or bad lighting, leading to
 reduced overs of play. This affects the chances of winning for both teams. In order to tackle this
 problem, various methods were introduced, such as Average Run Rate (ARR) or Most Productive
 Overs (MPO), which often results in leaving one side at a disadvantage. The DL method was
 introduced in 1997, which calculated the expected number of runs in the lost overs to estimate a
 new target. This method was significantly better than its predecessors, yet it still had limitations.
 In this project, we look into a new approach to tackle cricket interruptions in a more ’fair’ manner
 called the Iso-probability criterion. It was developed by Michael Carter and Graeme Guthrie. As
 the name suggests, it works on the principle of conserving the probability of winning for each team
 before and after the interruption. Using data from matches between 1999 and 2011, we test this
 method and analyze its effectiveness.
